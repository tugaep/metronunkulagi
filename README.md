cool little project that i created overnight on december 18th - 19th 2025

always had a thing to create something about istanbul metro and i saw [@overhearbogazici](https://instagram.com/overhearbogazici) got the idea to make the same stuff for m2 metro line then i realized i can make it for all lines. so i did.

i will start posting the submissions through instagram.

since i am still improving myself in design field i didnt really do branding for this. 

since you clicked on github you have a idea on what is going on and importance of open source projects.

right?

so any contributions are welcome. also if you have a friend who is a designer or u as a designer can reach out to [me](mailto:tugaep@gmail.com). i really would like to do the branding of this with a designer.

qr code is in the repo if you want to print it out and distribute to metro lines it would be really cool.

so yeah thank u

things i used:
- fetched data for metro info from [ibb api](https://api.ibb.gov.tr/MetroIstanbul/api/MetroMobile/V2/GetLines) (i had to add some lines manually)
- loveable to create template ui
- supabase for database
- couple of npm packages like nekojs for cats
- antigravity ide and gemini 3 high for coding assistant
- google analytics

thing is live on [metronunkulagi.com](https://metronunkulagi.com)
